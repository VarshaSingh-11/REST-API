# Rest API Framework for ReactJS Online Shopping Website

## Overview

Welcome to the Rest API Framework for the ReactJS Online Shopping Website! This project aims to provide a robust and efficient API architecture to manage user data effectively. Developed and implemented between January 2023 and April 2023, this framework significantly improves load times, enhances overall performance, fortifies system security with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication, and optimizes data processing time using JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## Key Features

- **Robust API Architecture:** Developed and implemented a robust API architecture to efficiently manage user data, resulting in a 60% decrease in load times and enhanced overall performance.
- **User Authentication with JWT:** Spearheaded the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication, fortifying system security and safeguarding sensitive user data, leading to a 30% decrease in unauthorized access attempts.
- **Efficient CRUD Operations:** Achieved a 50% decrease in data processing time by leveraging JavaScript and Node.js in a MongoDB environment, enabling efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for seamless data management.
